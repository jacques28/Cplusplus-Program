The goal of this project was to analyze and present data from grocery items. The client requested that the display reflect the quantity of the items in order to help them decide to make a decision.
### What did you do particularly well?
I was able to build a menu that uses the user arrow key
### Where could you enhance your code?
I could have simplified the menu and given the possibility to the user to input the specific item he was looking for.
### How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
This improvement will make the code logic easier to implement
### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
building the menu because I have to do some research to find the best way
### What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Dev-C++ was very helpful to code and compile the code I've written in C++
### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Ability to work with a variety of programming languages
### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To do this, I use object-oriented principles such as the use of classes also I added comments to make code understandable and transferable.
